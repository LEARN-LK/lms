# LIAF SSO - Shibboleth SP (Recommended for those who are familiar with Linux)

The LIAF SSO document describes how to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for their Learning Management System (LMS). It likely provides instructions on configuring and integrating SSO, enabling users to access the LMS with a single set of login credentials across various systems. This approach improves user convenience and security by minimizing the need to remember multiple passwords and simplifying the authentication process.
