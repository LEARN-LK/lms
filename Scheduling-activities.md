The Scheduler module is a handy tool that helps teachers efficiently schedule one-on-one appointments with their students. With this module, teachers can easily define their availability, set appointment lengths, and allow students to book appointments directly. It also allows teachers to record attendance and provide feedback or grades.

<h3>Key Features of the Scheduler Module:</h3>

* Convenient Scheduling: Define your availability by specifying the days and times you are available to meet with students.
* Flexible Appointment Length: Set the duration of each appointment based on your preferred meeting length.
* Student-Initiated Booking: Students can view your available timeslots and book appointments directly from the module.
* Attendance Tracking: Mark students as present or absent for each appointment to maintain accurate records.
* Performance Evaluation: Assess students' performance during appointments and provide feedback or grades accordingly.

<h3>Benefits of Using the Scheduler Module:</h3>

* Enhanced Efficiency: Optimize the appointment scheduling process, saving you and your students valuable time.
* Improved Communication: Foster clear communication between teachers and students regarding appointment scheduling.
* Personalized Support: Provide students with tailored attention and guidance through individual appointments.
* Effective Assessment: Gather valuable insights into student progress and understanding through appointment interactions.

  * Options will appear to add time slots. For this lesson, the slots you add can be real or fictitious, for practice. All time slots must occur in the future, and the start time must be before the end time. The simplest option is to:
* Click the "Start time" menu and choose a time that is one hour from now.
* Click the "End time" menu and choose a time that is one hour after the start time.
* Scroll to the bottom of the webpage and click "Save changes."
