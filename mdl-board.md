## Board Plugin

The Board plugin for Moodle is a collaborative activity that lets students and teachers create and organize content in a "post-it" style format. It enables educators to set up multiple columns or sections where students can add posts containing text, images, links, or even embedded videos. These posts can be edited, moved between columns, or deleted as needed, making it ideal for brainstorming sessions, project management boards, or collaborative research projects.

Teachers have the option to download board content or a spreadsheet of all submissions, including deleted ones, to monitor participation. Additionally, the plugin allows teachers to enable ratings, facilitating peer reviews. The Board can operate in various modes, such as whole-class or group-specific views, making it versatile for different teaching scenarios.

Initially developed by Brickfield Education Labs with funding from Dublin City University, the plugin aims to foster interactive learning and collaboration in both virtual and physical classroom environments
