<h1>Survey activity</h1>

The Survey activity provides a collection of validated survey instruments, such as COLLES (Constructivist On-Line Learning Environment Survey) and ATTLS (Attitudes to Thinking and Learning Survey), which have proven effective in evaluating and fostering learning in online environments. These tools enable educators to collect student feedback, enhancing their understanding of their classes and guiding their teaching approaches.

 `Please note that the Survey activity does not allow for customization of questions. If you wish to craft your own survey questions, consider utilizing the Feedback activity instead.`
