<h2>Using Safe Exam Browser</h2>

01. Visit the download page at https://safeexambrowser.org/download_en.html and acquire the most recent version of SEB. This software is compatible with Windows PC, Mac, and iOS. Keep in mind that SEB is not supported on Android phones or tablets, preventing the ability to take online tests on these devices.

07.    After you enter the username and password you will see the "Attempt Quiz Now" button - click this to start the quiz.
08.  You won't be able to open any other windows or to switch to other applications.
09.  When you are done, click the Submit All button for the quiz and then close the Safe Exam browser using the 'Terminate Session' button at the bottom-right of the screen. You will be returned to Moodle in your usual browser.
