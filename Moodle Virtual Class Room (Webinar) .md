The Virtual Classroom (vCR) stands as the pinnacle of educational technology for Higher Education. It operates as an on-premise hosted scalable cluster,  multi-million server and networking infrastructure. The backbone of this platform is the BigBlueButton web conferencing system, a free and open-source solution, tailored for online classes.

This cutting-edge platform revolutionizes the learning experience by maximizing the time dedicated to applied learning. It empowers students to collaborate seamlessly and receive real-time feedback, fostering an environment conducive to effective education.

Users have the flexibility to create personalized rooms for hosting sessions or effortlessly join others using concise and convenient links.

Furthermore, teachers affiliated with LEARN member institutions enjoy complimentary access to the platform, inclusive of free data usage.
