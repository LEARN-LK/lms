<h1>Adding users </h1>

This is a two-step process, 

* 01 - [Authentication]()
* 02 - Enrolment

<h3>Authentication</h3>
Everyone using your site is required to have an account. You may allow people to create their own account using email-based self-registration, or you may add new users individually, or you may bulk create accounts via a CSV file, or choose from several other authentication methods.

<h4>email-based self-registration </h4>
1. Go to Site administration > Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication.
