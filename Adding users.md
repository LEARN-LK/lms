<h1>Adding users </h1>

This is a two-step process, 

* 01 - Authentication
* 02 - Enrolment

<h3>Authentication</h3>
Everyone using your site is required to have an account. You may allow people to create their own account using email-based self-registration, or you may add new users individually, or you may bulk create accounts via a CSV file, or choose from several other authentication methods.

<h4>email-based self-registration </h4>
1. Go to Site administration > Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication.

Allowed email domains: Optionally, you can restrict self-registration to specific email domains.
Email confirmation message: This is the email that will be sent to users to confirm their registration.
Resending the confirmation email: This setting allows users to request a new confirmation email if they do not receive the original one.
Support contact: This is the email address that users can contact if they have problems with self-registration.

5. Click the Save changes button.
