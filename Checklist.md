## Checklist
The **Checklist plugin** for Moodle allows instructors to create task lists for students to track their progress through course activities. It provides a clear, interactive checklist where students can manually mark items as complete, or items can be automatically checked off based on completion of specific activities. The plugin includes a visual progress bar and options for email notifications, helping both students and instructors monitor course progress effectively.
