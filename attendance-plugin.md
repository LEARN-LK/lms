## Attendance Activity Plugin
### **Part 1: Attendance Activity Plugin**

The Attendance activity is designed to facilitate both teachers in recording attendance during class and students in accessing their individual attendance records.

Teachers have the flexibility to designate a student's attendance status as "Present," "Absent," "Late," or "Excused." These status descriptions are customizable, and additional options can be incorporated. To initiate the Attendance feature, the teacher includes it as an activity within a course and proceeds to establish sessions for tracking attendance.

The Attendance activity has the capability to generate reports, covering either the entire class or specific students. Students also have the option to view their own attendance records unless the activity is hidden.

For swift access to Attendance functionality, an optional Attendance block is available, providing teachers with quick entry to the feature and students with an expedited summary report of their attendance.
