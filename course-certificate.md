## Workplace Course Certificate

The **Workplace Course Certificate** plugin for Moodle allows organizations to issue digital certificates to participants upon course completion. It works as an activity within Moodle, enabling instructors to create and assign certificates automatically based on specific course requirements. The certificates can display personalized user data such as the student's name and course details.

This plugin is typically paired with the **Certificate Manager**, which provides tools to design reusable certificate templates. Templates can include digital signatures, verification QR codes, and dynamic data. Once the templates are set up in the Certificate Manager, the Workplace Course Certificate module pulls the relevant data to generate certificates when students meet predefined conditions, such as completing a final test.

Participants can access their certificates directly within the course or receive them via email in PDF format. Additionally, QR codes embedded in the certificates allow anyone to validate them even if the Moodle site has restricted guest access.

These tools are especially useful in workplace environments and structured courses, where automated and verifiable certification is required to acknowledge achievements systematically.
