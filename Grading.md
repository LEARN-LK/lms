<h1>Grading</h1>
Grading system is a comprehensive tool that allows instructors to assess student performance and provide feedback. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the grading system:

<h2>Grading from the Assignment page</h2>
<h3>Getting to the Activity Grading Interface</h3>
To grade assignments that involve student submissions (files, online text, etc.), access the grading interface directly from the assignment page. Navigate to the assignment and click on "View/Grade All Submissions [1].

The subsequent page provides an interface for editing grades, adding feedback, and reviewing students' work. At the top of the page, you'll find a that offers the option to download all student submissions [3]. This feature is particularly useful for assignments involving essays or other file-based submissions.

On the following page, you can enter a grade [5], provide feedback [6], and choose whether to notify the student. Once completed, click "Save". The "Save and Show Next" [7] button will save the grade for the current student and proceed to the next student's grading page.

<h3>Entering grades</h3>
To add grades directly into the grader report, activate editing mode by clicking the "Turn editing on" button located in the top right corner of the page. Once editing is enabled, each cell in the grid will display one or two input fields, depending on your gradebook setup. The input field with a solid border is used for entering grades, while the input field with a dashed border is used for providing feedback.
  
  In most instances, grades are saved automatically as you enter them. However, you may need to refresh the page to see the updated course total reflected with the new grades. In some cases, a "Save" button may be present in the bottom left corner of the page for manual saving.

<h3>Overridden grades</h3>
"Entering grades directly on this page will override the grades from the assignment and highlight the cells in yellow or orange. Changes made on the Assignment Grading page will not affect these grades."
