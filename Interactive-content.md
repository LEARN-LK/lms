<h1>Interactive Content</h1>

Interactive content in Moodle refers to any content that allows learners to engage with the material in an active way, rather than simply passively reading or watching. This can include a variety of activities, such as:

* Drag and drop: Learners drag and drop items to the correct location, such as matching terms to definitions or placing objects on a map
* fill in the blank: Learners fill in the missing words or phrases in a sentence or paragraph.
* Image hotspot: Learners click on different parts of an image to reveal information or answer questions.
* Interactive video: Learners watch a video and answer questions, complete activities, or make choices that affect the outcome of the video.
* Quiz: Learners answer a series of questions to assess their understanding of the material.

<h3>Interactive content can be created using a variety of tools, including:</h3>

* H5P: H5P is a free and open-source content creation tool that offers a wide variety of interactive content types.
 
* LTI tools: LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) is a standard that allows Moodle to integrate with a variety of third-party tools, including many that offer interactive content.
  
* Custom development: Experienced Moodle developers can create custom interactive content types.
