Assume you have to add categories and courses  following like this

   - Semester 01
     - Business Management
     - Economics
   - Semester 02
     - Statistics
     - Mathematics
2. Year 02
   - Semester 01
   - Semester 02

Before you create courses, you must add coerces categories (main & sub categories). You should follow the following steps:

- Go to the Courses  > Click Manage courses and categories > Click Create new
- Click on the " Click Create new category " button.
- Enter a name for your category and select a parent category.
- Click on the "Create category" button.
- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have created all of your categories.
- Once you have created your categories, you can begin creating courses.
  
<h5>Ex : Manin Category  <b>"Bachelor Degree Program </h5></p>
  <p>  Sub Category   <b>Year 01</b> </p>
	<p dir="auto" style=" margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>&emsp;&emsp;Semester 01</b></p>
 	<p dir="auto" style=" margin-bottom: 0px;&emsp;&emsp;"><b>&emsp;&emsp;Semester 02</b></p>

 <h5>Eg : Sub Category  <b>"Year 01</b> > Semester 01 , Semester 02 </h5></p>

sometimes it might be useful to have a sub-category of a course. For example, you might have a category "Bachelor Degree Program " and wish to have sub-categories  "Year 01" and "Year 02”.

You can make one category a subcategory of another by checking the box to the left of its name and then by selecting from the drop down menu 'Move selected categories to' You can create a new, empty sub-category by clicking the actions icon next to its name in Administration>Site administration>Courses>Manage courses and categories. and selecting 'Create new subcategory.'
