### What is a Private Youtube Channel?

If you set your YouTube channel to private, only the people you specifically grant access to can view your videos. Private videos are hidden from YouTube’s search results and recommendations and cannot be monetized. 

For video creators aged 13 to 17, YouTube automatically sets the channel to private by default. However, if you’re 18 or older, your videos will be public unless you choose to make them private. (Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to publish videos on YouTube.)
