<h1>Forum Activity</h1>

Moodle Form activity in Moodle 
A **forum activity** in Moodle is a tool for online discussions, enabling teachers and students to collaborate on specific topics. It supports different formats:

1. **Types of Forums**:
   - **Standard forum**: Open for anyone to start a discussion.
   - **Single simple discussion**: A single thread for all posts.
   - **Q&A forum**: Students post before viewing othersâ€™ replies.
   - **Each person posts one discussion**: Each student can start only one topic.

2. **Interactions**: Students post new topics or replies, fostering peer learning.

3. **Assessment**: Teachers can grade or give feedback on posts.

4. **Notifications**: Subscriptions notify users of new posts.

Forum activities are ideal for asynchronous courses, enabling collaborative learning outside traditional lectures.
