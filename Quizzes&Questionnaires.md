<h1>What is the Quiz activity</h1>

The Quiz activity in Moodle 4.0 is a tool that allows teachers to create and deliver assessments to their students. It supports a wide variety of question types, including multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and essay questions. Teachers can also add images, videos, and audio clips to their questions.

Quizzes can be graded automatically or manually. For automatically graded quizzes, the system will automatically assign students a score based on their answers. For manually graded quizzes, teachers will need to review student responses and assign scores manually.Students can take quizzes multiple times, and teachers can control how many attempts students are allowed and whether students can see their scores after each attempt.
